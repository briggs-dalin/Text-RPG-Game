Overview:

As a software engineering student, I created this text-based RPG to strengthen my skills in C++ development and to gain hands-on experience with object-oriented programming, file handling, and the Standard Template Library (STL). The project focuses on building a simple but engaging dungeon adventure where the player explores rooms, encounters enemies, and makes decisions that determine the outcome of the game.

The game is played entirely in the console. Players begin by choosing a character class, then navigate through a small dungeon where each room contains story elements, choices, and occasional combat encounters. Battles use a dice-roll system to determine hits and damage, adding unpredictability to the experience. When the player completes the dungeon, the game automatically saves their character stats to a file.

My purpose in creating this project was to practice core C++ programming concepts, understand how to structure a multi-file application, and build a small but functional program that could be expanded with more complex features in the future.

Development Environment:

This project was developed using C++ with Visual Studio Code as the primary editor. To compile and run the project, I installed the MinGW / MSYS2 compiler toolchain and configured VS Code for IntelliSense and build support.

Languages and Tools Used:

C++17

GNU g++ compiler (MinGW-w64 / MSYS2)

Visual Studio Code

Makefile for automated compiling

Standard Template Library (STL): vector, string, etc.

Key C++ Concepts Demonstrated:

Variables, expressions, conditionals, and loops

Functions and multi-file program structure

Object-oriented programming with classes

STL containers (e.g., std::vector)

A simple file-saving system using fstream

Custom combat and room-navigation logic

Future Work:

Add more rooms, enemies, and branching paths

Implement a system to load saved games

Introduce items, inventory, or loot drops

Add leveling, XP, and player abilities

Create ASCII art and more detailed story elements

Expand combat with skills or enemy AI
